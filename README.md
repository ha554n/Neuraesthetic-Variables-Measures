# Neuroaesthetic-Variables-Measures
A collection of scripts that measure 'neuroaesthetic' variables such as symmetry, balance, complexity, etc in images.

## Instructions for using scripts.

1. Set the paths to save the data in the body of the files;
2. Run woComplexity, choosing from two to six paintings;
3. Run only_complexity, choosing from two to six paintings;
4. Run thicknesseschiaroscuro, choosing from two to six paintings;
5. The results appear as follows:

a. Asymmetry is in the variable asymmetry;

b. Imbalance is in the variable imb_integr;

c. Complexity of Order 1 is in the second column of the variable complexity.results;

d. Complexity of Order 2 is in the third column of the variable complexity.results; 

e. Spatial Simplicity is in the eigth column of the variable complexity.results (labeled 'fall 1'); 
f. Thickness of the Balance Line is in the variable thickness;

g. Index of Chiaroscuro Extremes is in the variable chiaroscuroindex; 

h. Index of Chiaroscuro Intensities in in the variable COind1.

## Stimuli

PaintingsUsed.xlsx contains unique ARTSTOR (www.artstor.org) identifiers of all painting images used, along with their periods and stylistic classification. 

DataForSupplementaryMaterials.xlsx contains the data measured for each of these paintings.
